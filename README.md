# LangGraph Projects

A collection of hands-on projects built while learning **LangGraph** and modern **LLM agent architectures**.  
This repository focuses on understanding how stateful AI systems work, how agents coordinate tasks, and how tools integrate into graph-based workflows.

These projects are designed for experimentation, rapid learning, and building a strong foundation in **agentic AI development**.

## Why This Repository?

LangGraph enables developers to build **stateful, multi-agent AI systems** with memory and complex workflows.

Instead of jumping directly into large production systems, this repo helps you:

1. Understand agent graphs  
2. Learn how state flows between nodes  
3. Build tool-using agents  
4. Experiment with memory  
5. Practice real-world orchestration patterns  

## What You’ll Learn

- Graph-based agent architecture  
- State management  
- Tool calling  
- Node transitions  
- Multi-step reasoning  
- Memory persistence  
- Structured workflows
